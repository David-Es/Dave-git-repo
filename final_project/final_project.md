	<h1>Website Localization</h1>
	<h3>Final Project</h3>
	<h4>Description:</h4>
	<p>As stated in my final project proposal, I decided to try and localize the Global Detroit homepage into Spanish. Global Detroit is a non-profit organization that focuses on empowering immigrant communities in Southeast Michigan. I decided to only do the homepage because the website in its entirety has a lot of content. The site is hosted through WordPress. Therefore, the Global Detroit site was custom-made and generated through WordPress. The challenge with this project is that WordPress was not something that was covered in the course. I had to do my own research, but there were some unforseen issues.</p>
	<p>In the end, with advice from my professor, I decided that re-creating the homepage and localizing that into Spanish would be the best approach to this project. Even though I could not localize the acutal WordPress site, I did have access to the html, css, and script code of the live site. I took what I needed from that and only tried and localize what I was able to. There were some layout issues. As a result, I did not fully localize the homepage. I only localied what I could and I left content in English because if I translated that the layout would change. Because of time constraints, I opted to only translate that which did not change the layout completely. I knew this would be a challenge from the start. In the end, I managed to create something that I can continue working with over the summer. Since I will be interning with Global Detroit, I can continue working and hopefullly be able to localize the entire website into Spanish.</p>
